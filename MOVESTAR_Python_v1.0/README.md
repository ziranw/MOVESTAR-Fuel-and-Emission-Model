Open-Source Implementation in Various Platforms
===============================================

Python
----------------

MOVESTAR model is implemented in Python as a standalone ".py"
file that can process the speed data generated by vehicles in
advance.

In the current Python version of MOVESTAR model, there are only two
different vehicle types that the user needs to choose from. If the user
assigns "1" to the variable "veh_type" in the main function of "MOVESTAR.py" 
(towards the end of the script), then the tested vehicle
is assumed as a light-duty vehicle; Otherwise, if "2" is assigned, then
the tested vehicle is assumed as a light-duty truck.

In terms of the other input of MOVESTAR model besides the vehicle type,
the vehicle speed data needs to be processed by the user in the
second-by-second format with a unit of m/s.

The Python version of MOVESTAR model provides two output 
formats within the script, one is the total
fuel and emission results, while the other is the normalized results based on the travel distance.
All fuel and emission fields are shown in the table below.
